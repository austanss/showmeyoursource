## ***S***how ***M***e ***Y***our ***S***ource

Have you ever asked for help, and then immediately deny a request for source code?
Do you think that they are out to steal your source code, creativity, and hard work?

Guess what?

### They aren't.

You're lucky! You found someone who wants to help you!
They are asking for your source code. Are they:

   **a)** a person who wants to steal your work
   **b)** a person wants to steal your ideas
   **c)** a corporation too cheap to hire developers
   **d)** a person who wants to publicly shame your code style

If you picked any of those options, you are most likely wrong!
Nobody wants to steal your low quality, spaghetti-style, buggy and broken source code.

### Think about it.

Why would they want to steal broken code?
You are trying to fix an issue, an issue that they do not want to have.

### So pony up that source code.

It'll help you, and the person trying to help you, a million.
